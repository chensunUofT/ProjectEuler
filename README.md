In other words, it is like LeetCode for math; participants are asked to solve these complex math problems with whatever code or language they want, but it had better to take less than a minute.



The other files in this repo, namely `Euler Project.ipynb` and `Euler Project.md`, are supposed to contain the same content every time I update them. Feel free to read either of them.
